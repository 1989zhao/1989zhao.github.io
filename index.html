<h2>Visualising Cost and Schedule Issues for Education Department</h2>

<a> These visualisations show the experience in terms of schedule and cost planning to the government and investment organisations for Education Project future planning. Additionally, they also show the achievement in Education Project to citizens.

 <h2> Part 1: The Cost Visualisations </h2>

 <h3>Figure.1.1 </h3>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<div>
<a> (1).This visualisation compares the LifecycleCost, PlannedCost($M) and ProjectedCost($M) for the 50 education projects, which shows whether most of the actual cost of Education Projects meets the planned budget. In order to enable investment organisations and government to plan the future budget for education project development.</a>
<a> (2).These three kinds of cost are mainly range from 0.1($M) to 10 ($M). However,it also shows clear that the LifecycleCost for ProjectID 1368 is 25654.96 which not only much lager than PlannedCost 5837.8985,but also has a large gap with other peer projects. And ProjectID 1349 and 1353 also shows this problem, the LifecycleCost of ID.1349 is 136.24 and ID.1353 is 23.237, these two projects are much larger than the Planned and Projected cost and other projects.</a>
<a> (3).Additionally, although project ID.1352 cost extremely lower than other projects, but it met planed and projected cost, hence current analysis shows no error to this data. </a>

<h3>Figure.1.2 </h3>

    <script data-plotly="JIACONGZHAO:242" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>



<h3>Explanation</h3>

<div>
<a>Figure.1.2 is the trancing graph of Figure.1.1, which shows that most of the projected cost met the planned cost. It indicates that during the year 2009--2014 most of education projects are planned well. However, the comparison of these three cost shows that usually the LifecycleCost is higher. Especially for ProjectID: 1368, 1349, 1353, 1618, 1357 and 1354. These LifecycleCosts are more than the projected cost, it indicates that another type of cost is missed by this dataset.  </a>

<h2> Part 2: The Schedule Visualisations </h2>
<h3>Figure.2.1 </h3>

<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~JIACONGZHAO/195/" target="_blank" title="Education Project Date Issues Visualisation" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~JIACONGZHAO/195.png" alt="Education Project Date Issues Visualisation" style="max-width: 100%;width: 1166px;"  width="1166" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="JIACONGZHAO:195" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>




<h3>Explanation</h3>
<a> (1). This visualisation shows the Date issues of the Education Project for the investment organisations and government to visual the general duration of the education project to support the future plan time for the education project, and the this shows that education projects usually finished within 2-3 years.

    (2). There are 2 points clearly show errors:
    ProjectID 2860: the completion date is Sep/2017 however the projected date is Sep/2012, thus it is clear that the the completion year should be changed to 2012.
    ProjectID 1368: the started date is Sep/2007, however the started date for others are mostly range from 2010 to 2012, hence this stared date shows error.
        </a>
        
<h3>Figure.2.2 </h3>


<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~JIACONGZHAO/397/" target="_blank" title="Fitting Date Issues Visualisation" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~JIACONGZHAO/397.png" alt="Fitting Date Issues Visualisation" style="max-width: 100%;width: 1800px;"  width="1800" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="JIACONGZHAO:397" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>


<h3>Explanation</h3>
<a>The fitting visualisation shows that most of these education project are for the year 2011 to 2013. There are only 2 projects started in 2009, basically the date shows no significant errors but when look into it, it is clear that ProjectID 1618 and 1617 last for 5 years and 4years separately and without Planed time and Projected time, although it shows no clearly errors in data. However, when look at the the Planned Date and the Projected Date it can be seen that the Project with the name of of “New Award Year Release” and “Research and Development Environment” both missing the Planed Date and the Projected Date.</a>
